## üåü Key Features

This project was built from the ground up to showcase a wide range of modern web development skills, from backend architecture to a polished, performant user interface.

#### Core Functionality
- **Secure User Authentication:** Full user registration and login system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless sessions.
- **Full CRUD for Ideas:** Authenticated users can create, read, update (bookmark), and delete their own project ideas.
- **User-Specific Content:** Dedicated, protected pages for users to view "My Ideas" and "My Bookmarks".
- **Public User Profiles:** Click on any author's name to see a public page with all the ideas they have submitted.

#### Advanced Features
- **Live AI-Powered Idea Generation:** A protected route that integrates with the OpenRouter API to dynamically generate new project ideas based on user-provided keywords, using models like Mistral 7B.
- **Powerful Search:** A **debounced** search bar provides instant, case-insensitive search results across idea titles and descriptions, preventing excessive API calls.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Filter ideas in real-time by category (Software, Hardware, Hybrid) without page reloads.
- **Efficient Pagination:** Implemented a "Load More" pagination system to ensure fast initial load times and high performance.

#### UI / UX
- **Modern & Responsive Design:** A clean, animated, and fully responsive UI built with React and custom CSS, featuring a professional color palette and typography.
- **"Glassmorphism" Navbar:** A dynamic, semi-transparent navbar that changes style based on scroll position and page location.
- **Interactive Card Expansion:** Click on any idea card to view its full details in a smooth, animated modal overlay.
- **Client-Side Routing:** A seamless multi-page application (SPA) experience using React Router with protected routes and a custom `_redirects` file for Netlify deployment.
