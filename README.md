## üåü Key Features

This project is a comprehensive full-stack application that showcases a wide range of modern web development skills and best practices.

**User & Authentication:**
- **Secure User Authentication:** Full user registration and login system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless sessions.
- **Password Hashing:** Passwords are never stored as plain text, using `bcryptjs` for robust hashing on the backend.

**Core Idea Management:**
- **Create & Share Ideas:** Logged-in users can share their project ideas through a dedicated, protected route, specifying title, description, tags, difficulty, and category (Software, Hardware, or Both).
- **View & Discover Ideas:** A beautifully designed, responsive grid layout displays all project ideas.
- **Delete Functionality:** Users can only delete their own submitted ideas, enforced by backend authorization.

**Advanced Interactive Features:**
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Filter ideas in real-time by category (Software, Hardware, Both) without a page reload.
- **Powerful Search:** A **debounced** search bar provides instant, case-insensitive search results across idea titles and descriptions, preventing excessive API calls and improving performance.
- **Pagination:** Implemented a "Load More" pagination system to ensure fast initial load times and high performance, even with a large number of ideas.
- **Bookmarking System:** Users can bookmark their favorite ideas. Bookmarked ideas are saved to a dedicated, protected "My Bookmarks" page for easy access and management.

**UI & UX:**
- **Modern & Responsive Design:** A clean, animated, and fully responsive user interface built with React and styled with pure CSS, utilizing CSS variables for a consistent theme.
- **Client-Side Routing:** A seamless multi-page application (SPA) experience using React Router, with a professional welcome page, ideas page, and protected user-specific pages.
- **Dynamic Navbar:** The navigation bar intelligently changes its content and style based on the user's login state and current page.
